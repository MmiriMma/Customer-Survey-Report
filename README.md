# Customer-Survey-Report

 My attempt at customer experience analysis

## Problem Statement

This datset was gotten from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smmmmmmmmmmmm/customer-survey-report

The aim OF this DATASET is to analyze customer's interaction with the brand/product, identify pain points and customer experience gaps. differont variables ranging from product quality to price competitiveness to recommendation likelihood on a point scale of 1-5 and 1-10 were adopted in a bid to get a comprehensive analysis of customers's experience.


Some of the customer experience metrics I employed are;
CSAT _ Customer Satisfaction Score
CES _ Customer Effort Score
NPS - Net Promoter Score


For easier understanding I created two dashboards:
CX-CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE - dedicated to metrics i used in solving customer experience
CUSTOMER FEEDBACK

### INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATION

CSAT SCORE: overall, according to its terms and uses is a good score. but it could be better if further research on price competitiveness and product quality is done.
- is the price too high or low compared to other competitors
- what was the disappointment about the products and what was the expectation of the customers.


CES SCORE: On a point scale of 1-5, a good CES metric should be on a range of 1-2. this sits on a 3. website ease of use should looked into, if it is re-developed then service speed, delivery speed and support help will improve accordingly.


NPS SCORE: customer recommendation being on the negative is a problem as there is no better advertisement than word of mouth. this colud lead to customer churn. further data research is recommended to understand the expectations and dissapointment of customers.

Contact Channel: email seems to be the preferred channel for communication by customers. maintaining and upgrading of this contact channel will be very valuable with the use of the most efficient CRM tools 


Feedback Comments : there are two negative reactions(need improvements, average experience) and two positive reactions(great product, good service). it is a thing of concern that the negative reactions are on par with the positive reactions in percentage. this could be intepreted that the product is a fail. more research on the concerns, challenges and diasppointments of the overall satisfaction of customers should be done.


THERE IS A RISK OF CUSTOMER CHURN IF CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WITH THE BRAND KEEPS MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION. Reaching out to customers especially those with negative reviews and gaining insights into how the brand/product was found wanting is a good start.  And this will also mean to the customers that  their concerns are  being acknowledged and would ignite their hope stlll in the brand. Making them part of the community and keeping them updated about the progress is a  good start.
